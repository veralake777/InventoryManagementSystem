# Inventory Management System

## Scenario
You are working for a small manufacturing organization that has outgrown its current 
inventory system. They have been using a spreadsheet program to manually enter inventory 
additions, deletions, and other data from a paper-based system but would now like you to 
develop a more sophisticated inventory program.



They have provided you with a mock-up of the user interface to use in the design and 
development of the system (see the attached “GUI Mock-Up”) and a class diagram to assist 
you in your work (see the attached “UML Class Diagram”). The organization also has 
specific business requirements that must be included as part of the application. 
A system analyst from your company created the solution statements outlined in the 
requirements section based on the manufacturing organization’s business requirements. 
You will use these solution statements to develop your application.

##Requirements
###User Interface
 Create a JavaFX application with a graphical user interface (GUI) based on the attached 
 “GUI Mock-Up”. Write code to display each  of the following screens in the GUI: 



####A.  A main screen, showing the following controls:

•  buttons for “Add”, “Modify”, “Delete”, “Search” for parts and products, and “Exit”

•  lists for parts and products

•  text boxes for searching for parts and products

•  title labels for parts, products, and the application title 



####B.  An add part screen, showing the following controls:

•  radio buttons for “In-House” and “Outsourced” parts

•  buttons for “Save” and “Cancel”

•  text fields for ID, name, inventory level, price, max and min values, and company name 
or machine ID

•  labels for ID, name, inventory level, price/cost, max and min values, the application 
title, and company name or machine ID

 

####C.  A modify part screen, with fields that populate with presaved data, showing the 
following controls:

•  radio buttons for “In-House” and “Outsourced” parts

•  buttons for “Save” and “Cancel”

•  text fields for ID, name, inventory level, price, max and min values, and company name 
or machine ID

•  labels for ID, name, inventory level, price, max and min values, the application title, 
and company name or machine ID


####D. An add product screen, showing the following controls:

•  buttons for “Save”, “Cancel”, “Add” part, and “Delete” part

•  text fields for ID, name, inventory level, price, and max and min values

•  labels for ID, name, inventory level, price, max and min values, and the application

•  a list for associated parts for this product

•  a “Search” button and a text field with an associated list for displaying the results 
of the search


####E.  A modify product screen, with fields that populate with presaved data, showing the following controls:

•  buttons for “Save”, “Cancel”, “Add” part, and “Delete” part

•  text fields for ID, name, inventory level, price, and max and min values

•  labels for ID, name, inventory level, price, max and min values, and the application

•  a list for associated parts for this product

•  a “Search” button and a text field with associated list for displaying the results of 
the search

###Application
Write code to create the class structure provided in the attached “UML (unified modeling 
language) Class Diagram”. Enable each  of the following capabilities in the application:

####F.  Using the attached “UML Class Diagram”, create appropriate classes and instance 
variables with the following criteria:

•  five classes with the 16 associated instance variables

•  modify or change data values

•  save modifications to the data and then redirect to the main screen

•  associate one or more parts with a product

•  remove or disassociate a part from a product

•  cancel or exit out of this screen and go back to the main screen


####J.  Write code to implement exception controls with custom error messages for one 
requirement out of each of the following sets (pick one from each):

#####1.  Set 1

•  entering an inventory value that exceeds the minimum or maximum value for that part 
or product

•  preventing the minimum field from having a value above the maximum field

•  preventing the maximum field from having a value below the minimum field

•  ensuring that a product must always have at least one part

#####2.  Set 2

•  including a confirm dialogue for all “Delete” and “Cancel” buttons

•  ensuring that the price of a product cannot be less than the cost of the parts

•  ensuring that a product must have a name, price, and inventory level (default 0)F.
